# Food Ordering and Table Reservation System

This is a web-based application developed using PHP and XAMPP that allows users to order food online and reserve tables at a restaurant. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for customers and restaurant staff to manage orders and reservations effectively.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register, log in, and maintain their profile.
- **Browse Menu**: Users can browse through the available food items and select items to order.
- **Online Food Ordering**: Customers can place orders for food with options to add items to a cart and view the total cost before confirming.
- **Table Reservation**: Customers can reserve a table in advance for a specific date and time.
- **Order History**: Users can view their past orders and reservations.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage menu items, view and update orders, and handle table reservations.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP (for handling server-side logic)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL (via XAMPP's phpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: XAMPP (for local development and testing)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **XAMPP** (with Apache and MySQL enabled)

   Move the project files to the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation directory.

3. **Import the Database**:
   - Open phpMyAdmin by going to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.

   Example:
   ```php
   <?php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $user = 'root';
   $password = '';
   $dbname = 'food_ordering_system';
   ?>
   ```
